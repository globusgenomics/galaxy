#This is a sample file distributed with Galaxy that enables tools
#to use a directory of fasta and 2bit genome files for use with CREST. You will
#need to supply these files and then create a crest.loc file
#similar to this one (store it in this directory) that points to
#the directories in which those files are stored. The crest.loc
#file has this format (white space characters are TAB characters):
#
#<unique_build_id>	<window_length>	<display_name>	<gc_Content_path>	<mappability_window_path>
#
#So, for example, if your conserting.loc began like this:
#
#hg18    100     Human (Homo sapiens): hg18-100bp window /mnt/galaxyIndices/genomes/Hsapiens/hg18/annotation/conserting_gcContent_100    /mnt/galaxyIndices/genomes/Hsapiens/hg18/annotation/conserting_mappability_100
#
#then your /mnt/galaxyIndices/genomes/Hsapiens/hg18/annotation/ directory
#would need to contain the following fasta and 2bit files:
#
#
#drwxrwxr-x 2 galaxy galaxy        4096 Oct 30 05:06 conserting_mappability_100
#drwxrwxr-x 2 galaxy galaxy        4096 Oct 30 16:55 conserting_gcContent_100

#Note that for backwards compatibility with workflows, the unique ID of
#an entry must be the path that was in the original loc file, because that
#is the value stored in the workflow for that parameter.
