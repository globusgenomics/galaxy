USAGE: Type "ruby vcfPrinter.rb"  from the command line followed by "--usage" or "-h" to show the command line argument options.

	ruby vcfPrinter.rb 
		-i "<Location of your VCF files>" 
		-o <output file name> 
		-b "<Location of Bam files associated with VCF files>" 
		-r <Reference fasta file> 
		
		-n <Will not run pileup, hence will only merge data from single sample VCF. Samples without at a site will not have read level information gathered from samtools pileup making it significantly faster> 
		
		-p <Will not merge non-PASS variants, based on the PASS tag in filter field>
	
	Example command line:
	ruby vcfPrinter.rb -i "/home/user/data/*.vcf" -o /home/user/data/outfile.vcf -b "/home/user/data/*.bam" -r /home/user/ref/human_b36_male.fa
	
	Note: 
		* The VCF and BAM file arguments have to be wrapped in quotes ("). This is because of how glob are executed in Ruby. 
		* The BAM files need to be indexed.
		*The individual sample VCF filenames must follow the convention:
	 [sample_name].vcf and corresponding BAM files should be named [sample_name].bam

Note:
	* Rite now vcfPrinter has been designed only to work with Atlas Indel and Atlas SNP generated VCF files.

	* vcfPrinter requires single sample VCF files in v4.0 format. A description of the format can be found at:
http://www.1000genomes.org/wiki/doku.php?id=1000_genomes:analysis:vcf4.0

Changes:
1. Added the -p and -n options, which correspond to filter nonPASS variants and running vcfPrinter without the pileup option respectively.
