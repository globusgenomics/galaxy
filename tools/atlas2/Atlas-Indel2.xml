  <help>
Atlas-Indel2_ is designed to evaluate and distinguish true insertions and deletions (indels) from sequencing and mapping errors in whole-exome capture sequencing (WECS) data.

**Usage:**

ruby Atlas-Indel2.rb -b [input_bam] -r [reference] -o [outfile] [-S/â€“I]

**Mandatory arguments:**

-b, --bam=FILE

The input BAM file. It must be sorted. It does not need to be indexed. A read mask of 1796 is used
on the bitwise flag.

-r, --reference=FILE

The reference sequence to be used in FASTA format. This must be the same version used in
mapping the sequence. It does not need to be indexed.

-o, --outfile=FILENAME

The name of the output VCF file. Output is a simple VCFv4 file with a single sample. These files can
be merged into a more complete VCF file using the vcfPrinter (included). If the file already exists, it
will be overwritten. NOTE: For use with vcfPrinter, you should name your vcf file the same as your
BAM file, simply replacing ".bam" with ".vcf".

-I or -S

You must include one of these flags to specify either the Illumina or SOLiD regression model to be
used.

**Optional arguments:**

Note: Different platform modes have different defaults.

-s, --sample=STRING

The name of the sample to be listed in the output VCF file. If not specified the sample name is
harvested from the input BAM file name, taking the first group of characters before a . (dot) is
found. For example, with the filename "NA12275.chrom1.bam" the sample name would be
"NA12275".

-p, --p-cutoff=FLOAT

Defaults: Illumina:0.5, Solid:0.5

The indel probability (p) cutoff value for the logistic regression model. Indels with a p less than this
cutoff will not be called. Increasing this cutoff will increase specificity, but will lower sensitivity. If
you adjust this cutoff, you should usually also adjust the p-1bp-cutoff (see below).

-P, --p-1bp-cutoff

Defaults: Illumina:0.5, Solid:0.88

The indel probability (p) cutoff value for 1bp deletions. This may be set to a stricter standard than
the normal p-cutoff to increase callset specificity. This is very useful for SOLiD data, but should not
be generally needed for Illumina data.

-B --bed=FILE

Here you may specify a bed file which contians the region you wish to limit your indel calling to.
Only reads inside the region will be process, which can significantly shorten the runtime.

-O --orig-base-qual

This is the default for SOLiD, it is not recommended for Illumina data. This option has the algorithm
use the original base qualities as specified in the OQ tag if included in the BAM file. If the BAM file
does not include OQ tags, the normal base quality is used.

-N --norm-base-qual

This is the default for Illumina, it is not recommended for SOLiD data. This option specifies the
algorithm should use the normal base qualities, as specified in the QUAL column of the BAM file.

**Heuristic Cutoffs:**

Most of these variables have already been considered by the regression model, so you shouldn 't usually
need to alter them. However you are free to change them to meet your specific project requirements.

-t, --min-total-depth=INT

Defaults: Illumina:2, SOLiD:2

The minimum total depth coverage required at an indel site. Indels at a site with less depth
coverage will not be called. Increasing this value will increase specificity, but lower sensitivity.

Suggested range: 2-12

-m, --min-var-reads=INT

Defaults: Illumina:2, SOLiD:2

The minimum number of variant reads required for an indel to be called. Increasing this number
may increase specificity but will lower sensitivity.

Suggested range: 1-5

-v, --min-var-ratio=FLOAT

Defaults: Illumina:0.06, SOLiD:0.05

The variant-reads/total-reads cutoff. Indels with a ratio less than the specified value will not be
called. Increasing this value may increase specificity, but will lower sensitivity.

Suggested range: 0-0.1

-f, --strand-dir-filter

Default: Illumina:disabled, SOLiD:disabled

When included, requires indels to have at least one variant read in each strand direction. This filter
is effective at increasing the specificity, but also carries a heavy sensitivity cost.

-n, --near-read_end_ratio=FLOAT

Default: Illumina:0.8, SOLiD:1.0 (disabled)

The read end ratio is defined as the number of variant reads where the variant is within 5bp of a
read end divided by the total variant read depth. If this ratio is greater than the specified value, the
indel is filtered.

Suggested range: 0.7-1.0

-h, --homo-var-cutoff

Default: Illumina:0.6, Solid:0.5

The homozygous variant cutoff. This cutoff is used in the preliminary genotyping performed by
Atlas-Indel2. If the variant reads divided by the variant reads + the reference reads is greater than
this cutoff it will be marked as a homozygote, otherwise it will be marked as a heterozygote.
