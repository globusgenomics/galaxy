PROGRAM: vcfPrinter

INTERNAL_VERSION: 0.6

DESCRIPTION: Generates multi-sample Variant Call Format (VCF) file from single sample VCF files.

AUTHOR: Uday Evani, Fuli Yu

CONTACT: evani@bcm.edu

COMPILATION: None needed.

Change Log: 
v0.6 (9 January, 2013):
1. New option "--indel" to process vcf files containing indels. When processing indels vcfPrinter does not merge
multiple alleles at same coordinate position. Multiple alleles are represented in multiple lines.
2. Functions "commandLineSort", "collapseVariants" and "indelProcessing" moved into module functions.rb. To avoid redundancy.
3. Added unit test cases for VcfLine, Genotype.

v0.5 (6 December, 2012):
1. New option "--fast". Faster version of vcfPrinter stores all variants for all samples in memory.
works best for small number of samples (~20) and sites (~50000). The program will run into memory 
issues if used to merge large number of variants.
2. Logging implemented. Logs are written to printer.log

v0.4 (27 November, 2012):
1. Merged branched cluster version with stand-alone trunk on sourceforge.
2. Currently tested to merge vcf's containing SNP's only.
3. The cluster version requires that the vcf and pileup files be compressed using bgzip and indexed using tabix.

v0.3 (31 October, 2012): 
1. Removed -n option, if pileups are provided vcfPrinter will automatically use them.
2. VcfPrinter now prints the version number in the merged vcf file.

v0.2:
1. Added the -p and -n options, which correspond to filter nonPASS variants and running vcfPrinter without the pileup option respectively.

v0.1:
1. Inital commit.

REQUIREMENTS:

   * Unix-like operation systems
   * Ruby 1.9.2: http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/
   * Copy the settings.rb.default to settings.rb and fill in the details
   * Please read the "CLUSTER VERSION SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS" section for more details on how to run vcfPrinter on cluster

  Note: vcfPrinter has been tested on ruby 1.9.2

USAGE: Type "ruby RunPrinter.rb"  from the command line followed by "--usage" or "-h" to show the command line argument options.

 ruby RunPrinter.rb

       -i "*.vcf" REQUIRED "<Location of your VCF files>" 
       -o outputfile REQUIRED <output file name>
       -l "*.pileup" OPTIONAL "<Location of pileup files>"
       -p PASS (Only include PASS sites) OPTIONAL <Will only merge PASS variants, using the PASS tag in filter field>
       --indel OPTIONAL <If input contains indels; please use this flag>
       --fast OPTIONAL <Works best for small number of samples (~20) and sites (~50000)>
       --cluster OPTIONAL <This will run the cluster version>
       -c chromosome (Option specific to cluster version) OPTIONAL
       -n number of jobs [1] (Option specific to cluster version) OPTIONAL
	
  Example command line:
	ruby vcfPrinter.rb -i "/home/user/data/*.vcf" -o /home/user/data/output.vcf 
	
  Notes: 
	* The VCF and BAM file arguments have to be wrapped in quotes ("). This is because of how glob are executed in Ruby. 

	* The individual sample VCF filenames must follow the convention:
	  [sample_name].vcf and corresponding PILEUP should be named [sample_name].pileup .

        * The "--fast" version should only be used to merge small number of sites (~50000) in a small number of samples (~20). 
          Unless running on a large RAM (>10GB) machine the program will run out of memory if used to merge large number of variants.
        
        * VcfPrinter is designed / tested to work with Atlas2 generated VCF files. Merging non-Atlas2 vcfs can lead to unexpected results.

        * VcfPrinter has only been tested to merge SNP's.

	* vcfPrinter requires single sample VCF files in v4.0 format. A description of the format can be found at:
          http://www.1000genomes.org/wiki/doku.php?id=1000_genomes:analysis:vcf4.0

CLUSTER VERSION SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:

  The cluster version has been designed specifically for High Performance Computational cluster managed by Moab, developed by [Adaptive Computing](http://www.adaptivecomputing.com/products/). Job submissions and resource management is done by [TORQUE](http://www.adaptivecomputing.com/products/open-source/torque/) . 

 "qsub" is used to submit jobs to the cluster and "qstat" is used to monitor jobs.

  * Fill in the cluster specific settings section in settings.rb

  * Cluster version only accepts bgzip compressed and tabix indexed
    vcf and pileup files as input.
   
  * VcfPrinter should be able to invoke tabix by running 
    the command 'tabix' from the command line. tabix 
    can be downloaded from here 
    https://sourceforge.net/projects/samtools/files/tabix/
           
  * How to bgzip
    bgzip [sample_name].vcf
    This will create [sample_name].vcf.gz
                    
  * How to index
    tabix -p vcf [sample_name].vcf.gz
    This will create [sample_name].vcf.gz.tbi

  * If RunPrinter.rb was able to successfully submit jobs to cluster but you don't see
    output file, please look at the .err and .out file created by cluster command for cause 
    of the error.
