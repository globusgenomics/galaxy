== ea-utils Galaxy Wrapper ==

This is a Galaxy wrapper for some ea-utils tools, fastq-join and sam-stats.

** Installation **

Installation from a tool shed provides the necessary tool dependencies.

Otherwise, make sure fastq-join and sam-stats are in the path.
Move the test data files to your galaxy root test-data.
Move the xml files to a subdirectory of your tools directory and add lines in tool_conf.xml to point to them.
Restart the Galaxy server.
