Krona visualistion on generic hierarchy files. 

Input file must be a tab-delimited file with first column being a count, rest the hierarchy, for example::

    2	Fats	Saturated fat  
    3	Fats	Unsaturated fat	Monounsaturated fat  
    3	Fats	Unsaturated fat	Polyunsaturated fat  
    13	Carbohydrates	Sugars  
    4	Carbohydrates	Dietary fiber  
    21	Carbohydrates  
    5	Protein  
    4  

Would yield the following graph: http://krona.sourceforge.net/examples/text.krona.html
