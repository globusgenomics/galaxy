**What it does**

This tool creates a new BAM alignment file based on alignments that overlap (or optionally, those that do not overlap) intervals in another BED file.  Example usage would be to cull a BAM file from an exome capture experiment to include on the &quot;on-target&quot; alignments. 

.. class:: infomark

Note that each BAM alignment is treated individually.  Therefore, if one end of a paired-end alignment overlaps an interval in the BED file, yet the other end does not, the output file will only include the overlapping end.

.. class:: infomark

Note that a BAM alignment will be sent to the output file **once** even if it overlaps more than one interval in the BED file.

.. class:: warningmark
