About RSeQC
+++++++++++

The RSeQC package provides a number of useful modules that can comprehensively evaluate high throughput sequence data especially RNA-seq data. “Basic modules” quickly inspect sequence quality, nucleotide composition bias, PCR bias and GC bias, while “RNA-seq specific modules” investigate sequencing saturation status of both splicing junction detection and expression estimation, mapped reads clipping profile, mapped reads distribution, coverage uniformity over gene body, reproducibility, strand specificity and splice junction annotation.

The RSeQC package is licensed under the GNU GPL v3 license.

Inputs
++++++++++++++

Input BAM/SAM file
	Alignment file in BAM/SAM format.

Reference gene model
	Gene model in BED format.

Sample Output

Note:
- &quot;Total Reads&quot;: This does NOT include those QC fail,duplicate and non-primary hit reads
- &quot;Total Tags&quot;: reads spliced once will be counted as 2 tags, reads spliced twice will be counted as 3 tags, etc. And because of this, &quot;Total Fragments&quot; &gt;= &quot;Total Reads&quot;
- &quot;Total Assigned Tags&quot;: number of tags that can be unambiguously assigned the 10 groups (above table).
- Tags assigned to &quot;TSS_up_1kb&quot; were also assigned to &quot;TSS_up_5kb&quot; and &quot;TSS_up_10kb&quot;, tags assigned to &quot;TSS_up_5kb&quot; were also assigned to &quot;TSS_up_10kb&quot;. Therefore, &quot;Total Assigned Tags&quot; = CDS_Exons + 5'UTR_Exons + 3'UTR_Exons + Introns + TSS_up_10kb + TES_down_10kb.
- When assigning tags to genome features, each tag is represented by its middle point.
- RSeQC cannot assign those reads that: 1) hit to intergenic regions that beyond region starting from TSS upstream 10Kb to TES downstream 10Kb. 2) hit to regions covered by both 5'UTR and 3' UTR. This is possible when two head-to-tail transcripts are overlapped in UTR regions. 3) hit to regions covered by both TSS upstream 10Kb and TES downstream 10Kb.
