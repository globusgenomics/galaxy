Extracts read sequences and qualities from the input SAM/BAM file and writes them 
into the output file in Sanger fastq format. In the RC mode (default is True), if the 
read is aligned and the alignment is to the reverse strand on the genome, the 
read's sequence from input SAM file will be reverse-complemented prior to writing 
it to fastq in order restore correctly the original read sequence as it was generated
by the sequencer.

INPUT=FileInput SAM/BAM file to extract reads from Required.
FASTQ=FileOutput fastq file (single-end fastq or, if paired, first end of the pair fastq). Required. Cannot be used in conjuction with option(s) OUTPUT_PER_RG (OPRG)
SECOND_END_FASTQ=FileOutput fastq file (if paired, second end of the pair fastq). Default value: null. Cannot be used in conjuction with option(s) OUTPUT_PER_RG (OPRG)
OUTPUT_PER_RG=BooleanOutput a fastq file per read group (two fastq files per read group if the group is paired). Default value: false. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value. Possible values: {true, false} Cannot be used in conjuction with option(s) SECOND_END_FASTQ (F2) FASTQ (F)
OUTPUT_DIR=FileDirectory in which to output the fastq file(s). Used only when OUTPUT_PER_RG is true. Default value: null.
RE_REVERSE=BooleanRe-reverse bases and qualities of reads with negative strand flag set before writing them to fastq Default value: true. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value. Possible values: {true, false}
INCLUDE_NON_PF_READS=BooleanInclude non-PF reads from the SAM file into the output FASTQ files. Default value: false. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value. Possible values: {true, false}
CLIPPING_ATTRIBUTE=StringThe attribute that stores the position at which the SAM record should be clipped Default value: null.
CLIPPING_ACTION=StringThe action that should be taken with clipped reads: 'X' means the reads and qualities should be trimmed at the clipped position; 'N' means the bases should be changed to Ns in the clipped region; and any integer means that the base qualities should be set to that value in the clipped region. Default value: null.
READ1_TRIM=IntegerThe number of bases to trim from the beginning of read 1. Default value: 0. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value.
READ1_MAX_BASES_TO_WRITE=IntegerThe maximum number of bases to write from read 1 after trimming. If there are fewer than this many bases left after trimming, all will be written. If this value is null then all bases left after trimming will be written. Default value: null.
READ2_TRIM=IntegerThe number of bases to trim from the beginning of read 2. Default value: 0. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value.
READ2_MAX_BASES_TO_WRITE=IntegerThe maximum number of bases to write from read 2 after trimming. If there are fewer than this many bases left after trimming, all will be written. If this value is null then all bases left after trimming will be written. Default value: null.
